# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
1. Designed and developed a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard leveraging a dataset with key employee information such as EmpID, Age, Attrition, BusinessTravel, Department, EducationField, JobRole, and more.
2. The dashboard includes data cleaning processes.
3. Also include interactive visuals like text boxes, cards, treemap, donut chart, metrics, bar chart, pie chart, slicer, decomposition tree, scatter plot, and Q&A functionality.
4. Additionally, I implemented interactive features such as buttons for enhanced user experience and data exploration.
